# Cosmic Express Model

Cosmic Express is a 2D puzzle game where you must make a train route that delivers each alien from its starting point to a drop off point of the alienâ€™s colour.

Given a train track, our group aims to see if it works as a valid solution to a puzzle.

Our model will determine if each alien in a puzzle has been moved from its starting point to a respective drop off point, with none left unaccounted for.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
