# Cosmic Express Model

Cosmic Express is a 2D puzzle game where you must make a train route that delivers each alien from its starting point to a drop off point of the alienâ€™s colour.

Given a train track, our group aims to see if it works as a valid solution to a puzzle.

Our model will determine if each alien in a puzzle has been moved from its starting point to a respective drop off point, with none left unaccounted for.
